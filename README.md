**Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dataset**

**Overview**

This is an entity-level sentiment analysis dataset of twitter. Given a message and an entity, the task is to judge the sentiment of the message about the entity. There are three classes in this dataset: Positive, Negative and Neutral. We regard messages that are not relevant to the entity (i.e. Irrelevant) as Neutral.

Twitter sentiment analysis using NLP techniques provides valuable insights into public opinion and sentiment trends, which can be useful for various applications such as market research, brand monitoring, and crisis management. By leveraging machine learning and NLP, this project aims to analyze and understand the sentiment expressed in tweets, helping businesses and organizations make data-driven decisions based on public sentiment.
